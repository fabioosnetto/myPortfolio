            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>
               His story begins in a small town in the south of Brazil, however, he grew from one side to the other, making hundreds of a new friends, adapting to new realities.
               From an early age, detail-oriented, always wanting to gain prominence, which justified the nerd influence he came to have. After a while, the financial infuence gigantically changed his reality, when he began his studies on the stock exchange and general economy. Likewise, later on, thinking about automating financial operations, he began his studies in programming, wich had already been a present desire for some time. 
               His focus was increasingly on simplicity and sophistication, intelligence and wisdom rather than the superficiality of a nerdy schoolboy. A sudden and difficult change, but also not finalized, in order to always be in touch with evolution, without being too attached to current thoughts and customs.
               In no way is justified his way of thinking as correct, but as the chosen one, according to his preferences. Today, focused on what he considers worthwhile, he he studies and learns for the simple pleasure of the process. He revels in his work and hobbies, takings advantage of his skills and creating new ones.
